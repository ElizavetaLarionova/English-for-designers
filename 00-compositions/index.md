# How to draw unusual shapes - guide
## It is important to use simple forms here, nothing complicated, but be careful
- The first object is - house. Imagine an average house - as if a child had drawn it.
- Without doors, windows and pipes. Just walls. Draw this simple house.
- The second object you will need to draw is a big rectangle that's bottom is standing on the same line as the house's bottom so it becomes one line.
- Keep in mind that the width of the rectangle is 2.5 times smaller than the width of the house(first object).
